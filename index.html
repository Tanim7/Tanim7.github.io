    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a Computer Engineering graduate specializing in software systems, with hands-on experience in backend development, distributed systems, machine learning, and full-stack applications. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering (Software Stream) and completed a 16-month co-op at the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), where I contributed to grid performance analysis and compliance assurance projects. Proficient in C/C++, Java, Python, and SQL, I enjoy building reliable, scalable systems and applying engineering principles to solve real-world problems. I’m passionate about developing impactful software and continuously learning new technologies.
